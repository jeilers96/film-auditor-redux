I was surprised at how poorly written Hachi: A Dog's tale was. This film felt like a made-for-TV Hallmark movie that was written by a 50-year-old. The dialog and many of the scenes were very cliche and stale (ex: the skunk scene), making it hard not to roll your eyes while watching. The writing was also very emotionally manipulative, using a puppy's cuteness and other overly dramatic elements to play the audience. Another one of the major issues I have with this film is the pacing. There were many story elements that I felt should have been cut, and others seemed to happen too quickly. It also did not help that the film was missing a climax. The one moment that could have been the climax of the film took place a little over halfway through and felt abrupt, which I thought was an odd choice. Really, this film should have been much shorter; maybe like a 30 minute short. That would have helped with the pacing and left more of an emotional impact.

If you look past the stale writing, the technical aspects of the film are good. I really enjoyed some of the cinematography and visual choices that were made. I particularly enjoyed that all of the Hachi point of view shots were in black and white. This helped distinguish the dog's perspective, allowing the audience to understand Hachi's emotions better. Another aspect of the film I thought was done exceptionally well was the score. The composer's usage Japanese influences and the piano made for a very beautiful and captivating score.

Overall, I have mixed feelings about the film. On one hand, the dog is very cute and fun to watch at times, but on the other hand, the film is rather depressing poorly written. For these reasons, I don't think I would recommend this film. ★★½
