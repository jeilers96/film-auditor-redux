2018 was a good year for film. I was able to see a variety of films, some great, others... not so much. Despite being another heavy year of sequels and remakes, there were some amazingly original films. Here are my top 5 from 2018:

### 5. First Man ###
First Man was fantastic, I have already written a review that you can find [here](post/first-man-review). Check this one out if you haven't.

### 4. Won't you Be My Neighbor? ###
Even if you didn't watch Mr. Rogers when you were young, this documentary is extremely moving. I learned a lot about Mr. Rogers, and it had a good message that is very pertinent. Even if you don't normally watch documentaries, this one is worth seeking out.

### 3. Shoplifters ###
This Japanese crime drama was one of the most original and captivating films of the year. If you are don't mind subtitles this was easily one of the best films of the year.

### 2. Hereditary ###
Hereditary is one of the best horror movies in recent memory. I have already written a review, which can be found [here](post/hereditary-review). Definitely strong recommendation from me.

### 1. You Were Never Really Here ###
I didn't think any film would pass Hereditary on this list, but when I saw You Were Never Really Here, it shocked me. The movie had an emotional impact on me and just sucked me in. Hereditary is a close second, but this film had so much of an impact on me.
