I have always been a fan of space exploration, so when I heard this film’s premise, I was sold on going to the theatre opening weekend. With that being said, I had high expectations. The trailers made the movie look so unique, and after watching it, it surpassed my expectations. Ad Astra tells the fully original, thrilling, emotional, and thought provoking story of a man who has to face himself, his father, and the galaxy as he travels to the outer depths of the solar system to confront his father and save the earth. Through Roy McBride’s journey, the film explores themes of isolation, determination, and being grateful for what one has. The film also portrays a wide variety of moods throughout. There are many great scenes that are full of tension and suspense, and there are others that are emotionally powerful and memorizing. Despite the variety of themes and tones, it still feels like a very cohesive narrative with a thought-provoking message. 

On a technical level, two aspects that stood out were the cinematography and score. Each shot in the film seemed to have a great deal of thought and effort put into its composition. The use of reflections was a tool often used to create some really beautiful and interesting looking shots. Along with the reflections, the color choices really elevated the mood in some of the scenes. As for the score, I thought it was simple, but appropriately used to help evoke an emotional response from the audience. Both of these technical aspects were used to construct a beautiful viewing experience.

All praise aside, there were a few things I did not care for in this film. Some of the scenes felt a bit out of place and did not really add to the overall story. These felt like things the studio insisted on being in the film to make it more accessible. Some of the science jargon could have been turned down a bit as well. I think it would have been more mysterious if they didn’t try and explain a few things in a rather silly manner. 

Regardless of a few faults, I think this was one of the best movies of 2019 thus far. I had a lot of fun watching the film and felt absorbed by it the entire runtime. I would not have predicted this, but I think Brad Pitt has starred in my two favorite movies this year thus far. I really hope people go out and take a chance on this film because it desires some attention. ★★★★
