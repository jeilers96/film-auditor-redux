Swiss Army Man is a movie best summarized by a quote from the directors: "The first fart will make you laugh, the last fart will make you cry." The film tells the story of Hank Thompson, a depressed man stranded on an island whose life is changed when he discovers a dead body with the ability to aid him in survival. The film follows Hank and Manny (the dead body) as they develop a friendship and discover what makes life worth living.

The first five minutes of the film are a bit silly and weird, but once you get used to the concept, the film turns into a beautiful story of friendship. The movie is not afraid to play around with its tone. Sometimes the film feels fun and hilarious, filled with montages and music. Other moments take a more serious tone, commenting on bullying, social norms, and suicide. Surprisingly, this works very well.

On a technical level, Swiss Army Man is beautiful to both listen and look at. The soundtrack for the film, written by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell, is used beautifully to capture the emotions of the characters. The cinematography is vibrantly shot, utilizing reds, blues, and greens to compose wonderful visuals. Even the set design is delightful despite the film taking place primarily in the woods.

Both Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe give fantastic performances. Dano and Radcliffe have terrific chemistry, making their characters' relationship feel genuine. Radcliffe is hilarious as a dead body. What he does with his face and body is impressive; he makes himself look dead, but still full of emotion. Their performances are what drives the movie and makes this ridiculous concept work.

Despite making fart and dick jokes, the film is not afraid to comment on topics such as conformity, exclusion, self-love, and being yourself. This film is best seen blind. The trailer does not give justice to this wonderfully original, touching film. ★★★★★
