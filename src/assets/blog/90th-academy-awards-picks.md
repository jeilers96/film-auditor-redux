The 90th Academy Awards are finally here, and after watching 30 out of the 59 films (over 50%!) I am proud to say that this is the most successful I have been in watching so many of the nominees before the ceremony. Since I have seen so many of the films I thought I would make a post that discussed what winners I would chose in each category as long as I have seen the majority of the films. This is not a list of the films that I think are going to win, it is just my opinion on who should win. Here are my winners for the 90th Academy Awards:

### Best Picture – Phantom Thread ###
This is the First year I got the opportunity to see all nine of the nominees in this category. There was a lot of tough competition, but Phantom Thread enchanted me the most. It was the combination of the soundtrack, cinematography, Daniel Day-Lewis' Acting, and the overall story that makes Phantom Thread my choice for Best Picture.

### Lead Actress – Frances McDormand ###
I was able to see four out of the five nominations for Best Actress. The only film I missed was I, Tonya, which I was very disappointed I missed. Frances McDormand is my pick because her performance was the most captivating, and I loved her character.

### Lead Actor – Daniel Day-Lewis ###
I was able to see all five of the Lead Actress nominees this season. I enjoyed all of the performances in this category, but I thought that Daniel Day-Lewis' supposed final acting role was phenomenal. He was the star of that film, forcing you to stay invested in his character the entire film.

### Supporting Actor – Sam Rockwell ###
I missed All of the Money in the World this season, but I did see the other four nominations. Out of the four that I saw it was hard for me to choose between Willem Defoe and Sam Rockwell. For me Sam's role was slightly more interesting and so I chose Rockwell as the winner.

### Supporting Actress – Octavia Spencer ###
Octavia Spencer was one of my favorite parts of The Shape of Water. Out of the four nominations I saw in this category, she was the one that was the most entertaining. A close second would be Laurie Metcalf from Lady Bird.

### Director – Guillermo del Toro ###
The Shape of Water was a beautiful cross genre film that I thought was executed extremely well, making it easy to chose del Toro as my winner. I really enjoyed the other nominees work, but del Toro deserves to be awarded for this enjoyable film.

### Animated Feature – Loving Vincent ###
The only reason I am giving the win to Loving Vincent is because I haven't seen Coco yet, which I hope to see soon. I did not love Loving Vincent, but the animation was absolutely breathtaking. That's why it beats out Boss Baby and The Breadwinner.

### Original Screenplay – Get Out ###
Get Out was one of the most creative and important films of 2017 and that's why it was an easy choice for best Original Screenplay.

### Adapted Screenplay – Mudbound ###
Mudbound was one of the best films of the year. Out of the four films that I saw in this category it was my personal favorite and I thought the story seemed put together exceptionally well.

### Cinematography – The Shape of Water ###
I loved the way the camera was utilized in the shape of water. The opening credit sequence was particullary enjoyable for me. I think that if I had seen Blade Runner 2049 I would have picked that, but The Shape of Water was still a beautifully shot film.

### Documentary Feature – Not Enough Seen ###
I was only able to watch Strong Island, which I was not the biggest fan of. I wish I would have time to watch Icarus and the Last Men in Aleppo, but to be honest the feature documenaries were not the highest of priorities.

### Foreign Language Film – Not Enough Seen ###
Sadly, I was unable to watch any of the Foreign Language features mostly because I didn't have access to them, and I also ran out of time (dang homework).

### Documentary Short – Knife Skills ###
Out of all of the categories this year, this one was surprisingly one of my favorites to watch. I really enjoyed all of the documentaries in this category particularly Heaven is a Traffic Jam on the 405 and Knife Skills. I had to give the win to Knife Skills however because I thought the film's message was a bit more interesting.

### Live Action Short – Not Enough Seen ###
Sadly, I wasn't able to see any of these films. This has always been an infamously hard category to watch and this year was no different.

### Animated Short – Not Enough Seen ###
I only got that chance to see Dear Basketball and Revolting Rhymes, both of which I enjoyed. Unfortunately I didn't see enough of the nominations to pick a fair winner.

### Film Editing – Dunkirk ###
This category is hard for me since good editing usually goes unnoticed in a film. Dunkirk however did a really good job of balancing and intertwining the three different time sequences, which I think makes the film deserving of best Film Editing.

### Sound Editing – Dunkirk ###
One of the things I said when I left the theatre after seeing Dunkirk this summer was how amazing the sound was and that I bet it will win best sound Editing. Well I hope this comes true because I thought that this film's sound was astounding.

### Sound Mixing – Dunkirk ###
Same as above basically. The sound effects and the usage of sound in Dunkirk were one of the films best qualities. I could possibly be persuaded to pick Baby Driver since syncing music to an action sequence was awesome.

### Production Design – The Shape of Water ###
The sets in The Shape of Water were beautiful and unique. Del Toro's films always have a certain whimsical art style associated with them, and this film was no exception.

### Original Score – Phantom Thread ###
Jonny Greenwood's score in Phantom Thread was beautiful. I would love to give my pick to John Williams because I love that man, but I thought that the score in Phantom Thread really elevated my viewing experience.

### Original Song – Not Enough Seen ###
One of my least favorite categories and I only saw two of the nominations, and even after watching them I couldn't tell you what either original song sounded like.

### Makeup and Hair – Darkest Hour ###
This is an easy pick. If you can transform Gary Oldman into Winston Churchill, then I think you deserve an Oscar.

### Costume Design – Phantom Thread ###
The film about designing dresses is an easy pick for best Costume Design. The dresses in the film are also beautiful and unique making it an even easier choice.

### Visual Effects – Star Wars: The Last Jedi ###
Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the two front runners in this category: Blade Runner 2049 and War for the Planet of the Apes. Out of the three nominations I saw, the most visually pleasing film was Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

Those are my opinions on who I think deserves the win for each Oscar category. I would love to hear what your picks are or what you thought of mine.
