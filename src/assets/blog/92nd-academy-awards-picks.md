Oscar weekend is upon us! Despite being much earlier than past years, this oscar season I was able to see a lot of the films before the nominations were announced. I had already seen all nine best picture nominees, which helped give me more time to seek out other films that I missed throughout the year. This year I was able to watch 33/53 (62%) nominated short and feature length films. All of the films I watched made up 81% of the total nominations. Most of the films I didn’t see this year were ones that I didn’t really have any desire in seeing or were just too difficult to seek out. I was able to see many great films that I wouldn’t have seen if they weren’t nominated, and others I wish I wouldn’t have seen at all. Overall, it was a fun oscar season and as tradition, the weekend of the oscars I give out my choices for each award. This year I thought I would do something slightly different. Instead of just picking my personal choice of each category I will also give my prediction as to what will win.

### Best Visual Effects ###
This is a tough category. I was able to see all five of the nominees, but to me none of them really stand out. If *Ad Astra* was nominated I would definitely have chosen that film, but since it got snubbed I have to make a more difficult decision. I thought *Lion King's* special effects looked great sometimes and like a computer game at others. I have similar thoughts on *the Irishman*, however the technology they created so that the actors didn’t need to have to wear motion capture gear is pretty neat. I think overall my picks are:

__Should Win: *Avengers: Endgame*__

__Will Win: *The Irishman*__

### Best Costume Design ###
This category always comes down to period piece movies or war films. I’d love to see *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* win here since I think the costumes played a big part in making the movie feel so immersed in the time period, but I am guessing it will go to *Little Women* since dresses are a much flashier costume. Of course,  that's not to say *Little Women’s* costume design wasn’t fabulous. 

__Should Win: *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*__

__Will Win: *Little Women*__

### Best Live Action Short ###
Unfortunately, like the past 3 years I wasn’t able to see very many live action shorts. The one I did see, *The Neighbor’s Window*, I did like so I am rooting for that one.  

Should Win: Not enough seen to say

__Will Win: *The Neighbor’s Window*__

### Best Documentary Short ###
I was able to 3 out of the 5 nominees. One great, one okay, and one bad. *In the Absence* was my personal favorite, telling the story of a fairy ship in South Korea that sank and killed over 300 people, and the government knew about the disaster and basically did nothing. I’d love to see that film win, but I know there is more hype around a few of  the other shorts.

__Should Win: *In the Absence*__

__Will Win: *St. Louis Superman*__

### Best Animated Short ###
Overall, I felt the shorts were much weaker than past years. I didn’t love any of the animated shorts, but *Memorable* was at least a unique and beautiful story so I think that one was my personal favorite. Pixar’s *Kitbull* was too cliche for me to enjoy it. 

__Should Win: *Memorable*__

__Will Win: *Hair Love*__

### Best International Film ###
I was able to see 3 out of the 5 nominees in this category. The other two were just too difficult to find in my area. *Parasite* is the clear leader here and for good reason. It was by far my favorite movie of the year and I can almost guarantee it will win this award. Even though *Parasite* has this category on lock, I also really enjoyed *Pain and Glory*. I thought that was a very unique film and definitely in my top 10 of the year.

__Should Win: *Parasite*__

__Will Win: *Parasite*__

### Best Documentary Feature ###
This was a lackluster category for me this year. *For Sama* has gotten a lot of critical acclaim, but I attempted to watch it and couldn’t sit through it. Not because it was bad, but because it was very hard to watch. It had a lot of horrific imagery that I thought went a bit too far in places and that’s why I stopped watching it. Seeing 3 out of the 5 films, *American Factory* was my personal favorite. I thought it displayed the differences in culture China had compared to America, but it also displayed how in the end we are all just human beings. 

__Should Win: *American Factory*__

__Will Win: *American Factory*__

### Best Animated Feature ###
This year's nominated features were really weak. I don’t think I particularly like any of them, although I didn’t watch *How to Train Your Dragon 3*. The only one I thought was alright was *Klaus*.

__Should Win: *Klaus*__

__Will Win: *Toy Story 4*__

### Best Sound Mixing ###
An interesting category this year since I think all of the nominations had great sound besides maybe *Joker*. Of all the nominations I think *Ad Astra’s* use of sound and the large range of sounds made it ones of the best sounding films of the year.

__Should Win: *Ad Astra*__

__Will Win: *1917*__

### Best Sound Editing ###
Every year I have to look up the difference between this category and sound mixing. Sound Editing is the gathering and creation of the sounds in the film, whereas the mixing is the joining of all the sounds in the film. For this Category, Star Wars always has great sound editing, but there was something about the sound in *Ford V Ferrari* that really stood out to me. The sound of the cars, the changing gears, the revving engines. Sound plays a huge part in that film, and that’s why it's my personal choice this year. 

__Should Win: *Ford V Ferrari*__

__Will Win: *Ford V Ferrari*__

### Best Original Song ### 
This is my least favorite category at the Oscars, probably because it has the least to do with the filmmaking process. I have only seen two of the films so I won’t pick one.

__Should Win: Not enough films seen__

__Will Win: *Rocketman*__

### Best Score ###
John Williams. You gotta love the man and he deserves every nomination he gets, but his Star Wars score sounds no different than the last few movies. Not saying its not good, just sounds too similar to the other films. The real standout in this category was *1917*. I think the score really helped elevate the emotion and the intensity.

__Should Win: *1917*__

__Will Win: *Joker*__

### Best Production Design ###
To me this is an easy one. *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* literally decorated an entire block of Hollywood Blvd. to make it look like 1969. Not only that, but all of the other sets in that film were fantastic. 

__Should Win: *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*__  

__Will Win: *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*__

### Best Makeup and Hairstyling ###
This is a tricker category this year. I did think that the makeup for *Joker* was good, but I also really liked *1917’s* make up. However, I didn’t even see the front runner, *Bombshell*, so it makes choosing a bit difficult. I suppose the most memorable make up this year is probably Joaquin Phoenix’s makeup as he *Joker* so I will give it to it.  

__Should Win: *Joker*__

__Will Win: *Bombshell*__

### Best film Editing ###
I think *1917* should have been definitely nominated in this category, but for some reason the Academy doesn’t like nominating minimally edited films in this category (see *Birdman* for example). Anyway… as for the actual nominees I think *Parasite* was really well edited. It’s editing definitely helped heighten the tension in that film, and gosh was there a lot of tension. 

__Should Win: *Parasite*__

__Will Win: *Parasite*__

### Best Cinematography ### 
One of my favorite categories of the night, Cinematography can really persuade me from liking to loving a film. The nominations in this category are all pretty solid. I was a big fan of *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, *1917*, and particularly *the Lighthouse’s* cinematography. Sadly, this was *the Lighthouse's* only nomination (I am sorry Willem Defoe).

__Should Win: *The Lighthouse*__

__Will Win: *1917*__

### Best Original Screenplay ###
A really strong category of films this year, which is always nice since it sometimes feels like we are drowning in sequels and adaptations. I was able to see all 5 films and enjoyed all of them. *Parasite* being my favorite film of the year takes this one for me. Sorry Quentin, you were a close second. 

__Should Win: *Parasite*__

__Will Win: *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*__

### Best Adapted Screenplay ###
For me, *Little Women* was the best adapted screenplay nominated this year. I really thought Greta Gerwig took material that we have all seen and heard many times before and made it fresh, interesting, and relevant in 2019. 

__Should Win: *Little Women*__

__Will Win: *Little Women*__

### Best Supporting Actor ###
Talk about star power. All of the nominees in this category are excellent actors. I think all of these performances were great, but the most memorable character of all of these was Cliff Booth. Brad Pitt steals the show in *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, although Tom Hanks is a close second as Mr. Rogers.

__Should Win: Brad Pitt *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*__

__Will Win: Brad Pitt *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*__

### Best Supporting Actress ###
2019 was the year of Pugh. Florence Pugh was great in *Midsommar* and *Little Women*. Of all the little women her performance was the most memorable. Yes Laura Dern is great, but to be honest I thought her performance was a little forgettable when compared to Johansson and Driver. 

__Should Win: Florence Pugh *Little Women*__

__Will Win: Laura Dern *Marriage Story*__

### Best Actor ###
Was able to see all 5 films in this category. Jonathan Pryce in *The Two Popes* was great. Leo’s nomination seemed weird to me, but the whole ensemble of *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* was great so I guess I can understand it. Antonio Bandaras was also fantastic and similar to *The Two Popes*, *Pain and Glory* is an underwatched film. Which leaves two. Juaquin Phoenix and Adam Driver. I am personally on team Driver since his performance seemed more nuanced but I understand why people loved Phoenix’s performance.  

__Should Win: Adam Driver *Marriage Story*__

__Will Win: Juaquin Phoenix *Joker*__

### Best Actress ###
I feel like this category is very similar to last year. You have a veteran actress in a bad movie as the front runner, but like last year I think an upset is coming. 

__Should Win: Scarlett Johansson *Marriage Story*__ 

__Will Win: Scarlett Johansson *Marriage Story*__

### Best Director ###
4 great directors and then Todd Philips… I have been on the *Parasite* train so I got to side with the Bonghive. Although, if Mendes or Tarrantino wins I wouldn’t be that sad either. 

__Should Win: Bong Joon Ho *Parasite*__

__Will Win: Sam Mendes *1917*__

### Best Picture ###
The Grand Poobah of all Oscars, Best Picture. Some of my favorite films of the year are on the list of 9. Others are sadly missing (RIP *the Fairwell*). Here is my personal ranking of this years best picture nominees:

1. *Parasite*
2. *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*
3. *1917*
4. *Little Women*
5. *Ford V Ferrari*
6. *Marriage Story*
7. *Jojo Rabbit*
8. *The Irishman*
9. *Joker*

I think it's really a two film race at this point. *1917* and *Parasite* seem to be fighting it off for the top spot, but I do think *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* is the dark horse of the race and could possibly take home the win. I however, am rooting to see history be made with the *Parasite* win. 

__Should Win: *Parasite*__

__Will Win: *Parasite*__

Crunching the numbers, *Parasite* was my most picked for my personal choice with 5 wins, then *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* with 3, and *Little Women* and *Marriage Story* with 2. I am looking forward to Oscar Sunday. Happy Oscars!
