Unfortunately, being a student comes with its drawbacks and one of those is having large amounts of homework. Recently I have had a lot of work on my plate, which prevented me from seeing as many nominated films in the last two weeks as I initially planned. However, I did have time to see the last best picture nomination that I needed to see, Phantom Thread. I also knocked out the last best actor and one of the best supporting actress nominations by watching Roman J. Israel Esq. and Mudbound. Even though my progress was much smaller than I wanted it to be, I still completed one of my goals and got closer to completing the others. These are my thoughts on the films that I saw in the last two weeks:

### Phantom Thread ###
I absolutely loved Phantom Thread. From the moment the film started, I was captivated partially because of the soundtrack and cinematography, which were gorgeous. Almost every shot in the film is beautiful and the soundtrack provokes emotion when it needed too. I also loved Daniel Day-Lewis's acting in this film. He sucked me in. Everything he said and did in this film was somehow interesting to me, even eating asparagus. As for the story, I thought it was very enjoyable. You would think a movie about a man who makes dresses would be boring, yet this film is anything but. The film is very suspenseful at times and the twist towards the end of the film is very shocking. I would highly recommend this film, but I am aware that many will not enjoy this work of art. ★★★★★

### Mudbound ###
Mudbound is a film that doesn't pull the punches in showing the reality of racism in the post-World War II south. The realism that is put into this film makes me feel many emotions including sadness, anger, and even guilt. It is hard for me to believe that people could be so cruel and inconsiderate to someone just because they had different color skin. Racism was not the only thing covered in this film. Other subjects included PTSD, family, and gender roles. ★★★★

The technical aspects of the film were also well done. The Cinematography was beautiful and I thought the acting from Mary J. Blige, Garret Hedlund, Jason Mitchell, and Rob Morgan was great. I would definitely recommend this.

Side note: I don't think I have ever hated a character more than the grandfather!

### Roman J. Israel Esq. ###
This film was very weird. The film follows Roman J. Israel, a law genius from LA who is an introvert. The film starts stimulating, a bit hard to follow since there is a LOT of law jargon used and I do not have a J.D, but intriguing. However, the film takes a turn at one point and completely changes where I thought it was going. This change in direction was something I did not care for. I originally was feeling empathetic towards Roman, but after the change in direction, I grew to dislike the character. Another thing that I was not a fan of was the dialogue, epically the conversations between Roman and Maya. The way they talked to each other just seemed so pretentious and confusing. There was a lot about this film that disappointed me, but there were a few good things about the film.

I did think that Denzel's acting was good however; I think James Franco should have been nominated for The Disaster Artist instead. I also enjoyed the scene where Roman gives a talk at the charity meeting that Maya runs. That part of the film was thought provoking. Overall, I was disappointed by Roman J. Israel Esq. and would not recommend it. ★★½

### Loving Vincent ###
The best part about Loving Vincent was the animation. The fact that every frame is hand painted makes this film worth watching to see how this feat is done. However, once you get past the amazing animation style you see a film that is pretty standard. The film follows the story of a man trying to deliver a letter to Vincent Van Gough's brother after Vincent's death. The deliverer meets many people who knew Vincent right before he died, and all of them have different opinions on him and how he died. This can be confusing because you have so many characters saying different and contrasting things about Vincent causing you to eventually be unsure whom to believe. With that in mind, I did not love the story and some parts of it got pretty repetitive and boring. The only reason I give this film three and a half stars is because the animation is so incredible to watch. I could not help but think, how the hell did they do this! ★★★
