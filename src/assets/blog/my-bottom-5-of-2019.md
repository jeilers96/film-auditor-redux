These are the worst films I saw that came out in 2019. Not as bad as 2018, but still awful. 1 being the worst film of 2019.

### 5. Pokemon Detective Pikachu ###

I watched this film while I was bored on a plane. The lack of inspiration and anything interesting in this film made it hard to sit through. One good thing I have to say was the special effects did look nice, but everything else was mediocre at best.

### 4. Velvet Buzzsaw ###

Horribly pretentious and just downright dumb. Just a complete mess.

### 3. Secret Life of Pets 2 ###

This movie really didn't have much of a plot. I know its a kids movie, but unlike the original the writers had no ideas with this one. Very lazy and boring.

### 2. Lion King ###

This film never needed to exist. If I had to sum up the film in one word it would be soulless. This film is worse in every way to the original. The preformances are worse, the visuals are wose, the music is worse... everything is just worse. I have a feeling this version will be long forgot unlike the original classic.

### 1. Yesterday ###

I am a huge Beatles fan so I was excited to see this film because I thought the premise sounded interesting. Boy was a wrong. The film never took the concept in any interesting directions. So many unfunny jokes were just repeated over and over again. There was a cookie cutter love story that was dreadfully boring, but above all the music in it was just horrible. They took the Beatles great music and made it annoying. I have never been so tempted to walk out of the theatre. Absoutely horrible.
