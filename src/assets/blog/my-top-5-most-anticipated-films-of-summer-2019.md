### 5. Spider-man: Far From Home ###
After enjoying Avengers: Endgame, I think I am more excited for Spider-man: Far From Home than I was a month ago. It will be interesting to see how the result of Endgame effected Spiderman and the MCU as a whole. I enjoyed the first Spiderman, and I think with a more developed Spiderman, this film has the potential to be much better. This is the summer blockbuster that I am the most excited for.

### 4. Rocketman ###
I love the music of Elton john, but Rocketman looks more than just a greatest hits film like Bohemian Rhapsody. It looks much less like a generic â€˜origin story' biopic and a dive into Elton's life, similar to the film Ray. I also heard that Elton John was heavily involved in the film, which hopefully means it will be very close to what originally happened. The costuming and set design look very great in the trailer, not to mention some of the musical pieces look fabulous. I am hoping this film will stand out amongst the other classic rock biopics and really knock it out of the park.

### 3. Yesterday ###
Speaking of Classical rock... It seems like many films are playing off the popularity of classic rock, but instead of doing a straightforward biopic, Yesterday, goes for a much more creative story. The concept, what if one man was the only one who remembered The Beatles, is an amusing idea for a musical comedy and I really think there is some great potential. I think this film looks creative, and hope it will be much more than a Beatles sing-a-long. I am excited to see how the great concept is executed this summer.

### 2. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ###
Quentin Tarantino's 9th film. Do I have to say anymore? One of the most talented filmmakers in recent History, Quentin Tarantino is a filmmaker that's a must see in theatres (probably opening weekend). Not only is Tarantino directing it, but also the film's cast is crazy. Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, the list goes on. Tarantino always makes creative original films, so I am always excited to see what he does next.

### 1. Midsommar ###
Midsommar is the sophomore film from director Ari Aster, the director of Hereditary, one of my favorite films of 2018. With Aster coming hot off a fantastic horror film, I am optimistic for Midsommar. I think the trailer looks like atypical horror film with an original story, which is very exciting. Let's hope Midsommar lives up to my high expectations this summer.
