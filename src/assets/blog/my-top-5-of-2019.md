2019 had a bunch of great films. Infact, I feel like most of the films I saw were pretty good,. A couple stinkers here and there, but overall pretty good. Of course, it could be that I have gotten better at avoiding films that are bad... With that being said Here are my top 5 flims from 2019:

### 5. 1917 ###
One of the best war movies that have come out in recent memory, 1917's amazing cinematography, compelling story, and relatable characters made it one of the best films of 2019.

### 4. the Lighthouse ###
Robert Eggers' the Lighthouse was the best horror film of 2019. A much better sophmore debut compared to other horror directors: Jordan Peele and Ari Aster. The film has some great preformances by Robert Pattinson and Willem Defoe, some very unique cinematography, and a mezmorizing story. Its original concept and great execution earns it a spot on this list.

### 3. the Farewell ###
The Farwell was an emotional rollercoaster. One moment you are laughing the next you are crying. The film tells an interesting story that shows the differences and similarities between American and Chinese culture. This film had the most emotional impact of any film I saw in 2019.

### 1. Parasite ###
The first foreign language film to ever win Best Picture, parasite was easily my favorite film of the year. The story was thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat. Even if you aren't a fan of foreign film, you will still enjoy this film. Its one of the best movies to come out in the 2010's let alone 2019.
