These are the worst films I saw that came out in 2018. Boy... these were rough. 1 being the worst film of 2018.

### 5. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom ###

The original Jurassic World was mediocre at best, so I had low expectations for this film, but wow was it a disappointment. From the unlikeable characters, to the boring and unoriginal plot, the film had me looking at the clock at the half-way mark.

### 4. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again ###

I have already ranted enough about how much I dislike this film. You can find my review [here](post/mama-mia-here-we-go-again-review).

### 3. Ralph Breaks the Internet ###

I enjoyed the Original Wreck-It Ralph, and was sad to here they were making a sequel to it, especially one about the internet. Big corporations, such as Disney, are not good at depicting the internet in film and this film was no exception. The amount of product placement and cringe-worthy references left me frustrated and tired after the film was over. I would highly recommend avoiding this film.

### 2. Venom ###

I can admit that I am not the biggest superhero fan, but when some of my friends said they wanted to go see this film, I said "Why not..." Welp, I saw this and man was it just awful. I mean like laughably bad in some scenes. The writing in particular was some of the worst I've seen in a superhero movie in a long time. Horrendous story structure, boring characters, weird dialog... man what a mess.

### 1. The Nun ###

One of the most cookie cutter, lazy, un-scary, poorly written horror films I've seen in a while. This was obviously targeted at teens who just wanted to have jump scares startle them, but there were not even many of those in it. Gosh, I have no idea why anyone would find this film even remotely enjoyable. Easily my least favorite of 2018.
