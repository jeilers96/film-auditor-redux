        Hi, I am Josh Eilers, the man behind The Film Auditor. I started The Film Auditor blog to fuel my passion for both web design and film. This blog allows me to grow my writing, developing, and critical analysis skills all while talking about movies. Having my own unique platform allows me to discuss, critique, and rave about some of the films I see throughout the year.

        The reviews on this site can range from the newest blockbuster to an old classic. I write blogs about films that make me excited to write. Whether it's a hateful rant or a discussion of a film I love, I always try to bring my honest opinion through my own perspective. Diverse perspectives are one of the things that make film great. I can respect that others have different views to me, and I hope that people can respect my perspective as well. These differences in perspective allow for challenging conversations, which is one of the many purposes of film. With that, everyone reacts differently to a film. Do not be surprised if you disagree with some or many of the things I say. In fact, if you want to have a conversation about your thoughts on the film, I am more than happy to hear it.

    As for my background in film, I have loved movies since I can remember. Going to the movies with friends, having movies nights at home with the family, watching movies in the car during long car rides â€“ these are just a few memories I have growing up with film. My father was the main person that got me hooked on cinema. He loved showing movies from his childhood and adolescent years. Films like Rocky, 48 Hours, Top Gun, Caddy Shack, etc. However, it wasn't until high school that I discovered my love for movies. One summer, like many other kids, I was bored. I decided to go to my local Family Video because they were having free rentals for students in the summer. When I got there, I was overwhelmed with all the options and had no idea where to start. So, I decided to do some online research, and ended up on the boxofficemojo website where I found a list of the 200 highest grossing films of all time. Knowing that I had a long summer ahead and a lot of free rentals, I decided that I was going to complete the list as a challenge. By the time the summer was over, I was hooked on watching movies, and not just watching them, but studying them, talking about them, reading about them. At this point, I was watching 5 movies a week and loving it. This is really what started my love for cinema. Once I completed the top 200 highest grossing movies, I was starting to develop my own taste. I started watching movies that weren't on a list, but because they sounded interesting or I had liked the director's previous films I'd watched. This snowballed into me taking college classes on film, making my own short films, and all throughout, watching lots more movies. My love for cinema continues to grow. My taste ever evolving, ever changing. I hope that through my blog, I can share my passion for film I have developed throughout my life.
