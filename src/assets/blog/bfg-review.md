When I found out The BFG was directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Melissa Mathison, I was looking forward to it having a similar feel to one of my favorite films of all time — E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. However, upon viewing this film, I can say that I was sorely disappointed. This film lacks feelings of whimsy and adventure, something you might expect from a film based on a Roald Dahl book or a Spielberg movie. Instead, it feels rather forgettable and uninteresting.

I rolled my eyes so hard whenever there was farting on the screen. I mean really… farting corgis. I would have never guessed I would be watching a Spielberg film that contained a dog farting joke. CRINGE…

Getting past the farting jokes, something else I was disappointed about and found distracting throughout the film was the special effects. There were many usages of CGI that looked terrible. Some of the shots looked like the visual effects artists didn't do a good job of blending what was computer generated and what was real. Other shots had computer imagery that looked like they were straight from a videogame. I mean honestly, I expected more from Disney, but it seems like many of these CGI-heavy films still look unnatural. That's not to say there weren't any good-looking shots in the entire film. There are a few moments, such as the scene where Sophie and BFG enter the dream realm, that looked nice.

Despite all of that, there are some good things about this film. Mark Rylance's performance is probably the most obvious one. His motion capture performance is playful and fun. Many of the different faces and expressions Mark makes in the film genuinely made me smile. The same can be said for Mark's vocal performance, which was a perfect match for the big friendly giant. Another aspect that stood out to me was some of the small details in the film. The set design in particular had many clever details that really elevated the scenes and made the locations feel more like a fairy-tale. With that being said, I still would not recommend this one. Despite my love for Spielberg, I thought this was one of his worst films, and completely worth skipping. ★★½
