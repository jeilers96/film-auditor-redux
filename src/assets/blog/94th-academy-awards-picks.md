The Oscars are once again upon us and wow what an Oscar season it has been. Changing frontrunners, surprise nominations and snubs as always, and of course drama about how the Oscars are going to be televised. Regardless of all that, I am still excited to watch The Oscars after seeing 88% (47 out of 53) of the nominees, the highest percentage I have seen before the ceremony. In the past year, movie theaters have opened up again, and man was it nice to be back in the theater to see some of these nominees. Notable viewings include: seeing the memorizing *Dune* at the Alamo Drafthouse, watching *Spiderman: No Way Home* with some friends, and visiting the Heights Theater (Columbia Heights, MN) for the first time to see *Drive My Car*. Of course, like any year there were many stinker nominees, but it was fun watching all the films in preparation for today. With that said, here are the films I think will win and the films I think should at the 94th Academy Awards.

## Best Visual Effects ##
Both Shang-Chi and No Way Home felt like any other marvel movie visual effects wise, so those didn't jump out at me. I am not even sure why *Free Guy* was nominated. The Visual Effects, along with the rest of the movie, was bad. *No Time To Die* Had some awesome VFX and honestly would have been my pick if it didn't come out the same year as *Dune*. Dune's visual effects feel so real and helps create an incredible world.

__Should Win: *Dune*__

__Will Win: *Dune*__

## Best Costume Design ##
As much as I hate to say it, *Cruella* had some great costumes. I didn't see *Cyrano*, but the other nominees I think are all very deserving, and I do really think *Cruella* had the best costumes. Is it the best movie out of the bunch? God no.

__Should Win: *Cruella*__

__Will Win: *Cruella*__

## Best Makeup and Hairstyling ##
*Dune* again wowed in the technical categories and Hair and Makeup is no different. The different makeup done for the different races and creatures in the movie was really well done. It is significantly better than a bloated Jarred Leto in *House of Gucci* and the derivative work in *Coming 2 America*. Unfortunately however, I think the Academy will go with the transformative makeup in *The Eyes of Tammy Faye*, which was good, but not as unique as Dune's.

__Should Win: *Dune*__

__Will Win: *The Eyes of Tammy Faye*__

## Best Live Action Short ##
I was finally able to watch the majority of the nominees for this category (4/5). This continues to be my least favorite category of the shorts, but a few of these were good this year including *Please Hold* and *The Long Goodbye*. *Please Hold* was a unique nomination since it was a Science fiction short, which you don't see to often in this category. It also had some interesting ideas about automation, prison, and the justice system. I do think Riz Ahmed's *The Long Goodbye* will win, and I won't be mad about that at all.

__Should Win: *Please Hold*__

__Will Win: *The Long Goodbye*__

## Best Documentary Short ##
My favorite short category, the documentary shorts this year were just okay. Netflix's *Audible* was the standout for me this year, which focuses on a deaf high school football player and his relationships with other players, friends, and his family. Its only 40 minutes and worth a watch if you are looking for something on Netflix.

__Should Win: *Audible*__

__Will Win: *Audible*__  

## Best Animated Short ##
*Bestia* was one of the best nominees I have ever seen in this category. That animated short was haunting and the animation style was incredible. I loved the porcelain heads used for the characters, such an amazing artistic choice. I think the winner will be the safer more straightforward nominee *Robin Robin*.

__Should Win: *Bestia*__

__Will Win: *Robin Robin*__

## Best International Film ##
Some of the best movies of the year were nominated in this category. *Flee*, *The Worst Person in the World*, *Drive My Car*, and *Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom* were all incredible. on the other hand, no pun intended, *The Hand of God* was one of the most pretentious awful movies I watched all year. I could barely sit through it. I would be happy to see any of the nominations besides *The Hand of God* win, but it will likely be *Drive My Car* since it is nominated for best picture. It also happens to be my favorite of the bunch.

__Should Win: *Drive My Car*__

__Will Win: *Drive My Car*__

## Best Documentary Feature ##
I was only able to watch 3/5 nominees in this category, but the best one is clear to me. *Flee* was one of the best documentaries I have ever seen let alone of the three I watched. It was such a Beautiful, haunting story and the animation was great. Such a unique and boundary-pushing film.

__Should Win: *Flee*__

__Will Win: *Flee*__

## Best Animated Feature ##
Flee again takes it for me in this category. It is just eons better than any other of the nominees. Of course, this award is almost always awarded to Disney so it will likely be *Encanto*.

__Should Win: *Flee*__

__Will Win: *Encanto*__

## Best Sound ##
The sound in *Dune* was one of the best aspects of a technically brilliant film. It deserves the win in my book.

__Should Win: *Dune*__

__Will Win: *Dune*__

## Best Original Song ##
All the nominees in this category are boring. *No Time to Die* feels like a generic bond  and Dos Oruguitas is one of the worst songs from *Encanto*. The only song I thought that was mildly catchy was Beyonc√©'s Be Alive from *King Richard* so that gets my vote. They will give the award to *Noe Time to Die* because they want to see Billie Eilish win an Oscar.

__Should Win: *Be Alive*__

__Will Win: *No Time to Die*__

## Best Score ##
Both *Dune* and *The Power of the Dog* had great scores. I do think Hans Zimmer's operatic Dune score takes the cake on this one.

__Should Win: *Dune*__

__Will Win: *Dune*__

## Best Production Design ##
I think all of the nominees in this category have phenomenal production design. One of the best group of nominees this category has seen. I loved the production design in both *Dune* and *The Tragedy of Macbeth*, but the standout is *Nightmare Alley*. The sets and Cinematography in that film are the best aspects of it and I think the production design deserves a win.

__Should Win: *Nightmare Alley*__

__Will Win: *Dune*__

## Best Film Editing ##
One of the things I loved about dune's editing is how it incorporated flashforwards, dreams, and visions into the story. Dune's editing felt the most interesting, definitely much better than *Don't Look Up's* embarrassing editing.

__Should Win: *Dune*__

__Will Win: *Don't Look Up*__

## Best Cinematography ##
These are the same nominees as production design, and like I said earlier all of these are phenomenal. Seriously, it is really had to chose between *Dune* and *The Tragedy of Macbeth*, and *Nightmare Alley*. Even the other two nominees have very good Cinematography. I go back and forth between *The tragedy of Macbeth* and *Dune* both of them are absolutely gorgeous. In the end, I think I have to go with *Dune*.

__Should Win: *Dune*__

__Will Win: *Dune*__

## Best Original Screenplay ##
This category is a no brainer to me. *The Worst Person in the World* was one of the best films of the year and easily has the best original screenplay. Will it win? Probably not. My guess is Paul Thomas Anderson's *Licorice Pizza* walks away with the award.

__Should Win: *The Worst Person in the World*__

__Will Win: *Licorice Pizza*__

## Best Adapted Screenplay ##
*CODA* shouldn't be considered the frontrunner in this category and probably shouldn't have been nominated to begin with. Its a good movie, but the screenplay is by far the weakest part of it. I would love to see *Drive My Car* win this category, but I think it will likely be *The Power of the Dog*. If that film does win I would still be very happy because Power of the Dog was one of my favorite movies this year!

__Should Win: *Drive My Car*__

__Will Win: *The Power of the Dog*__

## Best Supporting Actor ##
Troy Kotsur gave one of the best performances in *CODA* this year, period. His performance was funny and emotionally impactful. He was the best thing about *CODA* and I would love to see him win.

__Should Win: Troy Kotsur, *CODA*__

__Will Win: Troy Kotsur, *CODA*__

## Best Supporting Actress ##
Jessie Buckley and Kirsten Dunst were the best performances in this category. The others were forgettable in my opinion. I would be happy if either of those two performances win, but I will be rooting for Kirsten Dunst in *The Power of the Dog*.

__Should Win: Kirsten Dunst, *The Power of the Dog*__

__Will Win: Ariana DeBose, *Westside Story*__

## Best Actor ##
This feels like a weaker group of nominees this year. None of these performances really jump off the page, but I think I would like to see Will Smith win for *King Richard*. Seeing the footage of the real Richard Williams, Will Smith nailed it. I would also be happy to see Andrew Garfield win for *Tick Tick Boom*.

__Should Win: Will Smith, *King Richard*__

__Will Win: Will Smith, *King Richard*__

## Best Actress ##
This category is tricky to predict a winner. My favorite performance was Olivia Colman's in *The Lost Daughter*. She continues to be one of the best Actresses working today and deserves to win again. I think Jessica Chastain will walk away with the win, but I will be a bit bored by it.

__Should Win: Olivia Colman, *The Lost Daughter*__

__Will Win: Jessica Chastain, *The Eyes of Tammy Faye*__

## Best Director ##
Steven Spielberg and Paul Thomas Anderson are two of my all-time favorite directors, but both of the films they were nominated for aren't there best works. Hamaguchi's *Drive My Car* is excellent, but Jane Campion's *The Power of the Dog* does everything right to deserve this win. I wish Denis Villeneuve was nominated because then he would have been my pick. All the technical achievements dune accomplished weren't directed by nobody!

__Should Win: Jane Campion, *The Power of the Dog*__

__Will Win: Jane Campion, *The Power of the Dog*__

## Best Picture ##
The Grand Poobah, the top dog, Best Picture. Here is my ranking of this years best picture nominees:

1. *Dune*
2. *The Power of the Dog*
3. *Drive My Car*
4. *CODA*
5. *Licorice Pizza*
6. *Nightmare Alley*
7. *King Richard*
8. *Belfast*
9. *Westside Story*
10. *Don't Look Up*

What can I say, I am a sucker for science fiction films and *Dune* was one of the best ones I have seen in a long time. I don't think it is likely to win, but to me it was one of the best movies of the year and a movie I can see myself rewatching multiple times. Hopefully part 2 is just as good!

__Should Win: *Dune*__

__Will Win: *The Power of the Dog*__
