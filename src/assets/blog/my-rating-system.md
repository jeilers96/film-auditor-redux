Creating a rating system for reviewing movies is beneficial to the reviewer and the readers. It makes the job of the film reviewer easier since it grants the ability to offer something quantifiable to film in addition to writing on it. The reader also benefits from films given a rating because it makes it easier for them to understand the thoughts of the reviewer without having to read the entire review. I view the rating system as an easy way to sum up a review and help compare films with one another to a degree.

Rating systems, such as five stars or a number system, have always seen so arbitrary to me. What makes something a 7/10 compared to a 7.5/10? There is usually no context to these ratings. I thought it would be important to put some meaning behind the five star rating system with descriptive words, and because of this, I came up with a system that briefly explains star meaning in accordance to my own scale. Here is my rating system:

| rating |  |
|---|---|
| ★★★★★ | Favorite/Legendary |
| ★★★★½ | Fantastic/Enriching |
| ★★★★  | Great/Memorable |
| ★★★½ | Good/Captivating |
| ★★★ | Mixed feelings/Has its moments |
| ★★½ | Disappointing/Uninteresting |
| ★★ | Poor/Flawed |
| ★½ | Awful/Frustrating |
| ★ | Unwatchable/Failure |
| ½ | Unbearable/Atrocious |

I think that will help clarify my opinions on the films I review. One thing to note is just because I give a film a high rating (four to five stars), it does not mean you will enjoy this movie. I would highly recommend you watching it, but everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. This is the same with any films I give a low rating (two to a half star). Just because I did not enjoy a film does not mean you will not love it. This is one of the best things about film, how it connects to people in different ways. You will disagree with my reviews at one point or another and that is perfectly okay, in fact, I look forward to it.
