Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has a much different feel compared to his previous filmography. Instead of tense scenes and thrilling action, Tarantino takes a more unique unconventional way of telling a story (which is, of course, what make him famous in the first place). Rather than having a clear narrative, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood feels like a collage of scenes that are connected by overarching characters, themes, and location. Some might think this is a negative of the film, but I thought it was one of the best parts of the film. Instead of having a straightforward narrative about the Manson Family, this film lets that idea bubble under the surface while exploring the ideas of changing times, the rise and fall of one's career, and a relationship between an actor and his stunt double. This story structure allowed each of the three main characters (Sharon Tate, Cliff Booth, and Rick Dalton) to shine in their own scenes and really explore their character. Yet, all three characters storylines have common themes, which hold the film together. 

On a technical level, this film is far above most Hollywood blockbusters. You can feel the artistry behind the camera. Instead of green screen sets and backgrounds, the sets are actually constructed, which give a much dirtier and lived in feel to the location. The best sets are the streets of Hollywood. I think I could watch Brad Pitt drive around those streets for hours. The amount of detail that went into all of the sets is astonishing and I'd hope to see this film be nominated for best set design. Not only was the set design great, but the shot composition, acting, and costume design was all top notch. Margot Robbie was perfectly cast as Sharon Tate, and Brad Pitt and Leo's chemistry was excellent. 

Overall, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It had some great moments of comedy, suspense, and drama. The characters are wonderfully crafted, and the film culminates to an exciting 3rd act. I think I have to rewatch a few of Tarantino's other movies, but this might be one of my favorites. I plan on seeing this one again very soon.
