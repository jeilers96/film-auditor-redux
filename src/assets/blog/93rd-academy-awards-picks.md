2020 was possibly the most unconventional year for movies. With cinemas closed because of the pandemic, 2020 had a much different movie going experience this year. Most of the movies that came out in 2020 were watched from my couch instead of a theater. In fact, the last movie I saw in theaters was Onward over a year ago. In spite of this strangeness, Oscars weekend is finally upon us. It also happens to be the weekend I get married! Let's just say I am excited. This Oscar season, I was a bit busier than normal, having to plan a wedding in the midst of a pandemic, but I was still able to see 36/56 nominations (64%).

I think this group of nominations will go down as one of the most unique years in Oscars history. With the lack of big budget movies being released in 2020, it made way for a lot smaller films to be nominated. Something like *Nomadland* wouldn't be the frontrunner in a normal year. This made watching the nominees interesting since I watched a lot of movies I wouldn't normally have sought out. Of course, there were some bad ones, and I mean really bad, but there were also some amazing films that came out this year. Despite all of the irregularities of this year, it was still a fun time to watch the nominees. With that said, here are the films I think will win and the films I think should win for each category.

## Best Visual Effects ##
A mixed bag of nominees this year. With all the big Visual Effects extravaganzas pulled from theatres, this category looks different than other years. *Mulan* and *Midnight Sky* had noticeably bad CGI so those are out for me. Although I wasn't a big fan of *Tenet*, some of the VFX set pieces are worth the win in my opinion.

__Should Win: *Tenet*__

__Will Win: *Tenet*__

## Best Costume Design ##
The classic fight for which period piece has the best costumes. In my opinion it's a toss up between *Mank* and *Emma*. I think some of Emma's over the top victorian costumes were memorable so that's my pick although I think the Academy will go with *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom*.

__Should Win: *Emma*__

__Will Win: *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom*__

## Best Makeup and Hairstyling ##
Kind of an underwhelming category this year. I didn’t get to watch the live action Pinocchio movie, which looked terrifying, but the nominees I did see I wasn’t blown away by any particular film in this category. Maybe the most standout makeup from the year was Gary Oldman’s in *Mank* so that gets my vote.

__Should Win: *Mank*__

__Will Win: *Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom*__

## Best Live Action Short ##
The category that got away... This category is one I always end up missing. I just don’t really enjoy the live action shorts. I did see *Feeling Through*, which was nice so I’ll route for that one. I think *The letter Room* will win just because it has Oscar Isaac, which means more people probably saw it.

__Should Win: *Feeling Through*__

__Will Win: *The Letter Room*__

## Best Documentary Short ##
My favorite short category, the documentary shorts this year weren’t as good as previous years. My favorite has to be *A Concerto is a Conversation*, which depicted the relationship between a black composer and his grandfather and them comparing how different their experiences as black men have been.

__Should Win: *A Concerto is a Conversation*__

__Will Win: *A Concerto is a Conversation*__

## Best Animated Short ##
A very hit or miss category this year. *Yes-People* and *Genius Loci* weren’t good, but I really enjoyed both *If Anything Happens I love you* and *Opera*. *Opera* has to be my choice this year because it is one of the most unique short films I have ever seen. If you haven’t seen it, it is worth seeking out.

__Should Win: *Opera*__

__Will Win: *If Anything Happens I love You*__

## Best International Film ##
I only saw one of the nominations in this category this year and it was awesome. *Another Round* is a fun movie that I would definitely recommend. You should also watch *The Hunt* (2012), which is by the same director and is insane.

__Should Win: *Another Round*__

__Will Win: *Another Round*__

## Best Documentary Feature ##
Another one of my favorite categories to watch, the documentaries this year were a diverse group of films. *Crip Camp* was a documentary with a great message and very informative, but very formulaic in its presentation. *The Mole Agent* was a thought provoking documentary showing the struggles of the elderly who live in assisted living. *My Octopus Teacher* was a unique nature documentary that followed a relationship between a man and an octopus. Lastly, *Time*, which was a documentary about a woman who tried getting her husband out of incarceration that fell flat for me. I missed *Collective*, which I heard was great.

__Should Win: *My Octopus Teacher*__

__Will Win: *Crip Camp*__

## Best Animated Feature ##
A lot of garbage in this category this year. *Over the moon* and *Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon* were just awful. Just an actual waste of time. I was really Looking forward to *Soul* and found it just okay; one of Pixar’s more mediocre films. This is why I have to go with *Onward*. Probably an unpopular choice over *Soul*, but I related more to it since it revolved around brothers. I will say, I wish I got around to watching *Wolfwalkers*, but didn’t feel like signing up for Apple TV+.

__Should Win: *Onward*__

__Will Win: *Soul*__

## Best Sound ##
This year, the Oscars merged the sound mixing and sound editing categories, which helps with the annual confusion of which category is which. *Sound of Metal* is the clear winner here for me. The way they use sound to replicate how a person who is losing their hearing would experience things makes this the clear winner.

__Should Win: *Sound of Metal*__

__Will Win: *Sound of Metal*__

## Best Original Song ##
The dumbest category at the Oscars. I don’t even remember what any of these sound like. I abstain.

__Should Win: Who cares__

__Will Win: Fight for You (*Judas and the Black Messiah*)__

## Best Score ##
This one is pretty straightforward to me. I don’t even remember any of the nominees scores besides *Soul’s*, so it's the clear winner.

__Should Win: *Soul*__

__Will Win: *Soul*__

## Best Production Design ##
*The Father* had the most noticeable production design to me. The very subtle changes in the set made The Father an even more incredible film. It's probably an unpopular pick, but it gets my vote.

__Should Win: *The Father*__  

__Will Win: *Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom*__

## Best Film Editing ##
It’s a crime that *I’m Thinking of Ending Things* was not nominated in this category. To me that easily deserved the win, but since I cannot choose that, my choice is *the Father*. I think the editing and structure of the film is what takes the film to the next level. All of the other nominees really had nothing special about their editing.  

__Should Win: *The Father*__

__Will Win: *Sound of Metal*__

## Best Cinematography ##
One of my favorite categories of the night, Cinematography can really persuade me from liking to loving a film. It’s a close battle between *Mank* and *Nomadland* in this category. I think when it comes down to it *Nomadland’s* Cinematography was a bit more memorable.

__Should Win: *Nomadland*__

__Will Win: *Nomadland*__

## Best Original Screenplay ##
A bit underwhelming group of nominees this year. *Sound of Metal* gets my vote since I think it was one of the more unique films of 2020.

__Should Win: *Sound of Metal*__

__Will Win: *Minari*__

## Best Adapted Screenplay ##
The fact that *Borat Subsequent Moviefilm* is nominated in this category is such a joke. A surprisingly good film on this list was *The White Tiger*. I would have never seen it if it wasn’t nominated for this, but it was very engaging. Despite that, *The Father* gets my vote in this category. From stage play to film. The transition was effortless and the screenplay was incredible.  

__Should Win: *The Father*__

__Will Win: *Nomadland*__

## Best Supporting Actor ##
The Only Choice in this category is Daniel Kaluuya. He steals the show in *Judas and the Black Messiah* and is easily the best part of that film. Sacha Baron Cohen shouldn’t have been nominated in my opinion. Constellation prize goes to Paul Raci in *Sound of Metal*.

__Should Win: Daniel Kaluuya, *Judas and the Black Messiah*__

__Will Win: Daniel Kaluuya, *Judas and the Black Messiah*__

## Best Supporting Actress ##
Amanda Seyfriend and Yuh-Jung Youn give some great performances this year, but I think Olivia Colman deserves another Oscar for her role in *The Father*. Sorry Glenn Close.

__Should Win: Olivia Colman, *The Father*__

__Will Win: Yuh-Jung Youn, *Minari*__

## Best Actor ##
A very diverse and great lineup of actors in this category. I don’t think I would be mad to see any of these nominees win. Chadwick Boseman, rest in peace, gave a great performance, which I thought was the best of the year, until I watched *The Father*. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances of his career, making him my winner.  

__Should Win: Anthony Hopkins, *The Father*__

__Will Win: Chadwick Boseman, *Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom*__

## Best Actress ##
Frances McDormand for the win. One of my all-time favorite actresses, period. She is incredible in *Nomadland*. Let's get the third.

__Should Win: Frances McDormand, *Nomadland*__

__Will Win: Carey Mulligan, *Promising Young Woman*__

## Best Director ##
This is an interesting category this year. A lot of lesser-known directors were nominated this year. Chloe Zhao is my personal choice, no disrespect for my man David Fincher, but *Nomadland* was incredible and I think we have Chloe Zhao to thank for that.

__Should Win: Chloe Zhao, *Nomadland*__

__Will Win: Chloe Zhao, *Nomadland*__

## Best Picture ##
The Grand Poobah, the top dog, Best Picture. Here is my ranking of this years best picture nominees:

1. *Nomadland*
2. *The Father*
3. *Sound of Metal*
4. *Mank*
5. *Minari*
6. *Judas and the Black Messiah*
7. *Promising Young Woman*
8. *The Trail of the Chicago 7*

*Nomadland* and *The Father* are almost tied for me. I think both are incredible films and I have gone back and forth on which one I like more. Regardless of my opinion, I think *Nomadland* will take home the big prize at the end of the night.

__Should Win: *Nomadland*__

__Will Win: *Nomadland*__

Crunching the numbers, *The Father* was my most picked personal choice wins with 5, followed by *Nomadland* with 4. I look forward to Oscar Sunday to see how correct I am with my predictions. Happy Oscars!
