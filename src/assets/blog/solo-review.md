With all of the negative news around Solo, the new Disney Star Wars movie, I did not have high expectations for the film. I also felt that the film seemed unnecessary since one of the best parts about Han Solo is his mysterious nature, so a movie that spells out his backstory seemed like an odd choice. Never the less, I saw the film and was surprised at how much I liked it, even though it had many glaring issues.

One of the things I really enjoy about this movie is how different it felt compared to the other recent Star Wars movies. Instead of a film about The Empire vs. The Rebellion, the film tells the story of a group of smugglers that steal and get themselves into trouble. The film did not need to have a grand scale “save the galaxy” storyline, which was refreshing. Secondly, the film did a better job with referencing the original movies. Instead of slapping the audience with “hey look, it’s a Star Wars reference,” the film was much more subtle. Solo did not have to use the Star Wars Universe as a crutch; it instead expanded it by adding many new aliens that looked really well done as well as some great new set pieces. All of these things helped Solo feel much more original than any other Disney Star Wars movie to date.

Another strong element that the film had was how Han and Chewbacca’s characters interacted. The characters acted very similar to how they did in the original trilogy, capturing the fun banter between Chewy and Han very well. It helped that Alden Ehrenreich’s performance was surprising well done. Ehrenreich did a great job capturing the spirit of Han Solo. He acted and sounded similar to Harrison Ford’s Han solo. Of course, Ehrenreich is not as charismatic as the charming Harrison Ford is, but he had big shoes to fill and he did a good job filling them.

Despite the movie feeling much more original than the other Disney Star Wars movies, this film still had many flaws that held it back from being a great film. The first thing that went wrong with the film was the lighting and cinematography. Particularly in the first half of the film, there are many shots where you cannot see what is going on. The shots were so dimly lit that in many scenes, it was hard to tell who or what was on the screen. Some of the colors also looked muddy, making the visuals less appealing than previous Star Wars films. I also thought the first act felt weak. The initial part of the story felt rather expository, even explaining how Han Solo got his name…I mean come on. It also felt like many of the scenes dragged a bit, until the second and third act, which felt better. Lastly, my main complaint of the movie is that it felt unnecessary. Han Solo never needed a backstory. Many of the plot points in this film were minor one-off mentions in the original trilogy that did not need their own film. The film does not add much to the Star Wars story, making it feel like nothing too special. This does not mean the film is not enjoyable. Solo feels like a fun but forgettable addition to the Star Wars story. ★★★½
