I haven't done an article about the Oscars for a few years, but this year I am back! I have still been watching lots of nominees and enjoying Oscar season. I am not as obsessive about seeing all the nominees, but I still try to see as many as I can as long as they don't look too terrible or aren't too difficult to find. This year, I was able to see 32/50 nominated films or 100/120 total nominations. The year was full of memorable movie events in my life. Seeing *Dune: Part 2* in theaters with friends, watching *Sing Sing* on my new surround sound home theater setup, groaning in disgust at *The Substance* in the Pálás Theater in Galway, Ireland. The list goes on. With a year full of great movies and great movie moments it gets me excited for this years Academy Awards. Here are my picks and predictions for the 97th Academy Awards.

## Best Visual Effects ##
I unfortunately, didn't get to watch either ape film that was nominated for best visual effects. *Alien Romulus*' special effects where the best thing about an otherwise underwhelming film. The production design in *Wicked* wowed me more then the special effects. *Dune: Part 2* is the film that really wowed me this year. The visual effects are seamlessly put into the film, making the illusion flawless. This is what good visual effects are all about; Selling an other-worldly science fiction setting and creatures with complete realness.  

__Should Win: *Dune: Part 2*__

__Will Win: *Dune: Part 2*__

## Best Costume Design ##
This category is a close race for me. I really enjoyed the costume design in *Wicked* and *Nosferatu*. One with very whimsical and fun costume design, the other more darker Victorian style. I think the shear amount of amazing costumes in *Wicked* will get it a deserving Oscar.

__Should Win: *Wicked*__

__Will Win: *Wicked*__

## Best Makeup and Hairstyling ##
I wish *Dune: Part 2* was given a nomination in this category, but I can understand given this is a very competitive category this year. *A Different Man* had me convinced that Adam Pearson was playing Edward in the beginning of the film. *Wicked* had some great hairstyling in particular. Count Orlok's make up was disturbing in *Nosferatu*, but nothing in that film was as disturbing as the makeup in *The Substance*. *The Substance* has some of the best make up in years, dare I say decades. The makeup is what sells the film; what makes the film so gross. If *The Substance* loses we riot!
__Should Win: *The Substance*__

__Will Win: *The Substance*__

## Best Live Action Short ##
I ended up seeing all but one nomination in this category. Many of the films nominated are typical for this category, but there was one that I thought was really fun and unique. *I'm Not a Robot* will be a live action short that I will remember and think of for some time. I hope it will win, but I think likely *A Lien*, will win due to its timely message about ICE.

__Should Win: *I'm Not a Robot*__

__Will Win: *A Lien*__

## Best Documentary Short ##
This is always my favorite of the shorts categories. This year, the documentary shorts were mostly depressing. *Death by Numbers* was a really hard watch. Its discussion of the Parkland school shooting and the fine details of what happened on that day will haunt me. The *Incident* was horrible to sit through. Seeing a man shot in broad daylight by police officers and the aftermath afterwards was disturbing. That's why I was happy when I got a change of tone while watching *Instruments of a Beating Heart*. It might not be the most important of the documentary shorts, but this short about a class of first graders in Japan performing "Ode to Joy" was very sweet and full of humanity.

__Should Win: *Instruments of a Beating Heart*__

__Will Win: *The Only Girl in the Orchestra*__  

## Best Animated Short ##
This was a weaker year for the animated shorts. *Wander to Wonder* and *Magic Candies* were the two I enjoyed the most. Both contained some great stop motion animation. I think the story and heart of *Magic Candies* had a bit more depth, so that's why its my pick and my prediction.

__Should Win: *Magic Candies*__

__Will Win: *Magic Candies*__

## Best International Film ##
I have been dying to see *I'm Still Here*, but the local theaters never played it where I live. As for the other nominations, I saw *Flow*, which I thought was cute, but a bit too simple for my taste. *Emilia Pérez* has been the most controversial film in this years race. I saw it before it got a lot of hate and didn't like it at all. It was only after where I learned about all the controversies. Let's just say, its not a good movie with or without the controversies. I never got to the two other nominees, so I don't really have a should win for this category since I didn't like the two nominations I saw. With that said, I am rooting for *I'm Still Here* to make an upset over *Emilia Pérez*.

__Should Win: N/A__

__Will Win: *I'm Still Here*__

## Best Documentary Feature ##
I didn't get to watch any of the Documentary Features this year. Many of them were hard to find and I didn't have a strong urge to watch any of them. My prediction is based solely on what I've read about the nominees.

__Should Win: N/A__

__Will Win: *No Other Land*__

## Best Animated Feature ##
Unlike the documentary feature category, I was able to see all 5 of these nominees. I already touched on being underwhelmed by *Flow*, but was equally underwhelmed by *The Wild Robot*. Maybe I had too high of expectations going in because I heard so much good things, but I felt this film would have been better as a short instead of a feature. *Memoir of a Snail* and *Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl* were both okay stop motion films. I am usually not a big fan of sequels, but *Inside Out 2* was enjoyable. Now, its no where near as good as the original, but I thought the film did a good job building on the original and the introduction of new emotions was fun.  

__Should Win: *Inside Out 2*__

__Will Win: *The Wild Robot*__

## Best Sound ##
The sound in *Dune: Part 2* was one of the best aspects of a technically brilliant film. It deserves the win and will win.

__Should Win: *Dune: Part 2*__

__Will Win: *Dune: Part 2*__

## Best Original Song ##
*Emilia Pérez* got two nominations in this category, both of which I didn't like. The Elton John song wasn't good, and Diane Warren deserves to never win, so I am going to go with "Like a Bird" the original song from *Sing Sing*.

__Should Win: "Like a Bird" *Sing Sing*__

__Will Win: "El Mal" *Emilia Pérez*__

## Best Score ##
The only score that really stuck with me and was memorable was the score from *The Brutalist*. I think it should win and will win.  

__Should Win: *The Brutalist*__

__Will Win: *The Brutalist*__

## Best Production Design ##
This is a competitive category this year. The production design in *The Brutalist* was excellent, and really, a main part of the story. *Dune: Part 2* has production design that creates an amazing science fiction world. However, *Wicked* has some amazing sets. So many of the sets that I thought were 100% CGI were actually real built sets. The library and Emerald City production design in particular where very memorable.  

__Should Win: *Wicked*__

__Will Win: *Wicked*__

## Best Film Editing ##
I think its a close race between *Anora* and *The Brutalist*. For me, *The Brutalist* had some really memorable transitions and the overall editing style is reminiscent of older Hollywood epics.

__Should Win: *The Brutalist*__

__Will Win: *Anora*__

## Best Cinematography ##
I loved the cinematography in *The Brutalist*, *Dune: Part 2*, and *Nosferatu*. I thought *Emilia Pérez* had some nice shots, but nothing like the other three. *Maria* is a film I skipped because I thought it looked very uninteresting. The cinematography in *Nosferatu* was the best thing about the film, but *Dune: Part 2* had the most memorable shots of the year for me.

__Should Win: *Dune: Part 2*__

__Will Win: *The Brutalist*__

## Best Original Screenplay ##
Coralie Fargeat's *The Substance* screenplay is the clear winner for me this year. The high-concept horror film not only was horrifying, hilarious, and disturbing, but was also a great commentary on the role of beauty standards in Hollywood and society. IT was one of my favorite movies this year and I hope it wins this category. Realistically, I think *Anora* is much more likely to win.  

__Should Win: *The Substance*__

__Will Win: *Anora*__

## Best Adapted Screenplay ##
I am a bit confused as to why *A Complete Unknown* is nominated in this category. That film is a pretty by the books music biopic. A fun film, but not a great screenplay. *Emilia Pérez* - ew no, why was this nominated too. *Nickel Boys* had a good screenplay, but the two that were my favorite in this category are *Sing Sing* and *Conclave*. The true story behind *Sing Sing* is amazing, and I would highly recommend this film if you haven't watched it already. On the other hand, *Conclave* was carried by its screenplay. The whole film is almost entirely dialog between characters. Debates between Cardinals, hushed meetings in private to discuss who should be the next pope. I loved all the mystery in *Conclave* and that's why I'd like to see it win.

__Should Win: *Conclave*__

__Will Win: *Conclave*__

## Best Supporting Actor ##
The fact that Clarence Maclin wasn't nominated for his role in *Sing Sing* is outrageous. His performance was much better than any of these nominees. Unfortunately though, I cannot pick someone who isn't nominated. I liked all of these performances fine. Kieran Culkin has this category all but guaranteed on Oscar night. He has won every precursor award you can, and I get why. He is great in the movie, but his role is almost too much of a main character to really be in this category. Yura Borisov was great in *Anora*, but didn't feel like his character was really relevant till the end of the film. I think Guy Pearce's performance in *The Brutalist* is the most memorable out of these, but again Clarence Maclin people, come on!

__Should Win: Guy Pearce, *The Brutalist*__

__Will Win: Kieran Culkin, *A Real Pain*__

## Best Supporting Actress ##
I love Isabella Rossellini, but I have no idea why she is nominated for her role in *Conclave*. She is in it for like five minutes. A good five minutes sure, but someone like Margaret Qualley in *The Substance* is much more deserving. Zoe Saldaña seems to be the frontrunner in the category, but I could see Ariana Grande sneaking in a win. My two favorites out of the nominees were Monica Barbaro in *A Complete Unknown* and Felicity Jones in *The Brutalist*. Maybe its because I love Joan Baez, but I really thought Monica Barbaro was great in that role. She has like zero chance of actually winning, but she gets my vote.

__Should Win: Monica Barbaro, *A Complete Unknown*__

__Will Win: Zoe Saldaña, *Emilia Pérez*__

## Best Actor ##
This is a great class of nominees this year. Sebastian Stan's performance is probably the weakest, but he was great in an otherwise mediocre film about the current president. I love Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan and would love to see him win, but I think Colman Domingo, Ralph Fiennes, and Adrien Brody gave better performances. The biopic Oscar winner is tired Timothée, sorry. Colman Domingo's powerful performance in *Sing Sing* was really emotionally moving and think he is deserving of the win. I won't be mad if Fiennes or Brody win it though.

__Should Win: Colman Domingo, *Sing Sing*__

__Will Win: Adrien Brody, *The Brutalist*__

## Best Actress ##
Again, I am very sad to not have seen *I'm Still Here* yet, so unfortunately I don't have an opinion on Fernanda Torres' performance. As for the other 4, Karla Sofía Gascón and Cynthia Erivo are both a no from me. This leaves the two frontrunners, Mikey Madison and Demi Moore. I think either of them winning it would be great. Part of me wants a young Mikey to win for *Anora*, but I loved *The Substance* as a movie more and Demi is great in it. I think if you force me to pick I go Mikey.

__Should Win: Mikey Madison, *Anora*__

__Will Win: Demi Moore, *The Substance*__

## Best Director ##
Denis Villeneuve was again snubbed from this category for *Dune: Part 2*; such a shame. I know you are probably sick of me talking about *Dune: Part 2*. James Mangold for *A Complete Unknown* and Jacques Audiard for *Emilia Pérez* should not be nominated period. Sean Baker's indie film direction for *Anora* is great and I wouldn't be mad to see him win. On the flip side, Brady Corbet's bombastic and bold directing style in *The Brutalist* really makes the film. If it were up to me though I have to go with the body horror film, so Coralie Fargeat for *The Substance* gets my vote.

__Should Win: Coralie Fargeat, *The Substance*__

__Will Win: Sean Baker, *Anora*__

## Best Picture ##
And finally, the top dog, Best Picture. Here is my ranking of this years best picture nominees:

1. *Dune: Part 2*
2. *The Substance*
3. *Conclave*
4. *The Brutalist*
5. *Anora*
6. *Nickel Boys*
7. *A Complete Unknown*
8. *Wicked*
9. *Emilia Pérez*

Again, *I'm Still Here* is missing since I wasn't able to see it. *Dune: Part 2* was my favorite film of the year, and just like the original I loved it, but don't think it has any chance of winning. I think the winner will likely be *Anora* since it has won a lot of the major precursor awards.

__Should Win: *Dune: Part 2*__

__Will Win: *Anora*__
